  So you’ve decided to learn a programming language.<br/> Good thinking!</b></h2><br/><h3>The need to be code literate for various jobs is increasing. Software developer jobs specifically will increase by 17% according to The Bureau of Labor Statistics.</h3>
<img src="img/i3.png" width="400" height="350">
<h3>However, as a beginner, proceeding from making that career-boosting decision to actually acquiring the skills is definitely confusing. <br/>You’re faced with hundreds of options to pick from as your first language.</h3>
<h3> So, before making that choice, it’s a good idea to ask yourself two key questions:
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>What is it that made you interested in programming?</li>
  <li>What do you want to do as a programmer?</li><br/></h3>
<h3>The answers to these questions will navigate your initial steps and, possibly, your entire programming career. If a project idea sparked your interest, pick a language that helps you best complete it. For example, learning Objective-C will allow you to work on iOS-related projects, while Java will allow you to work on Android-related projects.
<br/><br/>
But if you’re interested in turning this new knowledge into a full-time career, use the first language to learn how to think like a programmer and learn basic programming logic. For example, developers regard Ruby, Python, and JavaScript as relatively easy to learn and as languages that provide a solid foundation in programming logic and syntax. If you have a good foundation, picking up more will be easier because certain principles translate from one to the other.
<br/><br/>
Or possibly, the one you pick may be decided for you because of the part of the technical stack that interests you. A front-end developer works on user-facing code, which involves learning JavaScript. A back-end developer works with the server, database, and application which may involve languages like Ruby or Python.
<br/><br/>
Beginner or not, quality programmers seek out opportunities to learn and keep up with language and technology trends. The choice to pick up a new one will be recurring throughout your career. Check out this helpful infographic to guide you through making this decision.
